# Jesse's ARENA Virtual 

Exercises for the 2022 [ARENA Virtual Program](https://www.arena.education/).

> **Note**
> This was forked from [a template](https://github.com/callummcdougall/arena-v1) provided by Callum McDougall, who wrote most of the tests and utils. I've reorganized the repo to be more informative (and completed the exercises).

The exercises consist of a combination of:
- Recreating parts of `torch` to understand the internals (and build NNs from scratch).
- Reimplementing well-known models (AlexNet, ResNet, GPT-2, BERT, U-Net, etc.)
